            People in the industry often perceive that Scrum is a framework used for developing a product, while Kanban is exclusively
            used for either user or tech support. I tend to disagree, as Kanban can be great solution for many development
            teams, especially those that are struggling with their process.

            Kenneth S. Rubin considers placement of Scrum and Kanban in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework"
                target="_blank">Cynefin framework</a> in his book “Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile
            Process”. Rubin argues that Scrum is particularly well suited for Complex domain, where as Kanban is good for
            Interrupt-Driven work environments.

            Some background on the story... Developing a product that is already in production is tricky business. Life cycle of the
            software after release often tends to be Interrupt-Driven. Sometimes a client needs an urgent feature. Sometimes
            iOS user gave your application 1 star review because of a new bug that just popped out. You simply need to take
            action right away. Regardless of how complex the product is, in reality most product development lines do not
            have dedicated teams for both maintenance and development, instead of having one development team which needs
            to handle the interruption.

            I have seen many Scrum teams struggle with this, as fast paced products sometimes do not even have a week ahead of predictability.
            If you already have a sprint underway, chances are that in that situation you will take something of equal size
            and lesser priority out of the sprint and replace it with something that just jumped in. Which ultimately, because
            of the lack of predictability needed to improve Scrum properly, leads to Scrum losing its value. If you are not
            in a sprint and your current process is not yielding needed results you should definitely consider Kanban. Kanban
            is great because it is easy to implement over existing practices and brings transparency into the flow very quickly.

            Before starting, please bear in mind that Kanban is not a golden bullet for the software development project. Although its
            flow reflects agile values and provides multiple benefits, advanced software development practices like Continuous
            Integration, Peer Reviews, Pair Programming and Test Driven Development are essential for large scale organizations
            in order to deliver high quality software.

            Kanban not as fully encompassing compared to Scrum/XP/DA as it is silent regarding software development practices. It has
            only 3 prescriptions:
            <br>1. Visualize your workflow
            <br>2. Limit Work-In-Progress
            <br>3. Measure flow to maximize the output

        <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-0"></div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12 blog-post-text animated bounceInRight">
            <b>Visualization</b><br> Lets discuss the benefits of those. First, visualizing your workflow is a must for any
            managed software development project, and can easily be done with tools like Jira or Trello. The most basic Kanban
            boards tend to have three states:
            <br>1. To Do
            <br>2. In Progress
            <br>3. Done
            <br><br>In real life software development, chances are that you will soon realize that you are missing a few
            more:
            <br>1. To Do
            <br>2. On Hold
            <br>3. In Progress
            <br>4. Deployed To Staging
            <br>5. In QA
            <br>6. Ready for Release

        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12 blog-post-text animated bounceInRight">
            Why <i>On Hold</i>? Since we are limiting Work-In-Progress, sometimes software engineer might start working on
            something, but needs more info in order to proceed with the work. As we do not want our engineers to sit idle,
            the best idea is to put a ticket On Hold while the engineer works on the next thing in queue.

            <i>Deployed to Staging</i>, or however you want to name it depending on the development platform, is really handy
            because it gives an overview to QA team that the item is ready for them to start testing. Depending on the testing
            results, tasks might move from QA state to To Do state if issues are found or to Ready for Release state if the
            task meets the requirements to be released.

            <b>Limit WIP</b><br> Limiting Work-In-Progress is also important because all you need is a quick look against
            the board to see the overview of current progress. If it seems like the engineer is solving multiple tickets
            at the same times, that means that the tasks are too massive and you might want to consider using something like
            <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2014/january/the-invest-scale" target="_blank">INVEST principle</a>.
            Some teams tend to adjust to higher number of Work-In-Progress items, but I tend to advise against that. When
            you really think about it, engineers always work on one task, as engineers usually tend to come with no more
            than one pair of hands and one pair of
            <eyes class=""></eyes>

            <b>Measure and maximize</b><br> Measuring the flow and maximizing the output is about removing unnecessary waste.
            First place to look is usually impact of meetings and development practices(or lack of same) against the value
            your developers are creating. Anything that is not creating value for your product should be eliminated in the
            least painful way for the team.

            The next step is on you. There are plenty of good resources out there, my first suggestion would be ‘Agile Project Management
            with Kanban’ by Eric Brechner.
