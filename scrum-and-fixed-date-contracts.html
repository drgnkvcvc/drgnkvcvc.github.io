        Lately I have witnessed quite a few talks whether Scrum can or should be used for projects with fixed date contracts. In real world software project contract two things are always strictly specified - scope and date. Quality is, however, usually left out.

    <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-0"></div>
    <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12 blog-post-text animated bounceInRight">
        Why is that so? There are two main reasons. First, it is really hard to specify quality. Can you count it by the number of the bugs? Or by the severity of the bug? Unless the bug is blocking the usage of the software, bug severity is something that is prone to discussion and therefore hard to strictly specify in the contract.

    <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12 blog-post-text animated bounceInRight">
        That is the reason why often the fixed date projects tend to fulfill the scope by the agreed date, but quality is the first to suffer. Those who argue that you can use scrum to deliver projects by the fixed date suggest negotiating the scope instead of a quality with your client.

        But what if the whole scope is really crucial for business? We can cite the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Pareto principle</a>, but truthfully that principle can be applied to a project that has vast amount of features. What if you need to deliver small invoicing system in a matter of two months? In real life invoicing features don’t really function without vendors, and vice-versa. On the other hand, if you have a vast amount of features, rock-stat negotiators and understanding clients, you might consider negotiating the scope cut. But that trick usually won’t work twice.

    You can benefit tremendously by providing an estimate that is real, instead of an estimate that your clients want to hear.

        One of the great benefits of the Scrum is improving quality and getting feedback back as soon as possible. Even if you are working with fixed date, if you have the opportunity, deliver an MVP to your client as early and as often as you can. Not just to ensure that you are not building in the wrong direction, but also to build up the trust. “I don’t care to see first build of my product” said nobody ever.

        In case of fixed date contracts, try instead using some techniques to break down the scope better, plan more precisely and get to know your teams velocity better. Do not be afraid to voice out concerns early and place buffers just-in-case. You can benefit tremendously by providing an estimate that is real, instead of an estimate that your clients want to hear.
