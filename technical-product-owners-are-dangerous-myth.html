            There is a myth going around that technical people should never become Product Owners. During the Winter 2016, one local company
            even organized a meetup for Agile people to discuss the dangers of having a Product Owner who is a technical
            person as well. The issue here is not really whether the Product Owner is too technical, but whether the
            same Product Owner is a good business person as well.

            There are many benefits of having a Technical Product Owner. Some of the benefits were excellently described by Steve Vaughn
            in <a href="https://www.techwell.com/techwell-insights/2013/09/how-agile-led-creation-technical-product-owner"
                target="_blank">this blog post</a>. But what are the dangers?

            For those who claim that Technical Product Owners are always dangerous for the product, my first question is what if your
            product domain is technical? Would you hand off the product intended for other developers to someone who has
            not developed software themself?

        Understanding the technology usually helps understanding the trade-off better.

            In case that your product is not in the technical domain, is it dangerous? It is not, no more that having a non-technical
            Product Owner who does not know his product's domain. It comes down to how good Return-Of-Investment the Product
            Owner is creating. While someone might claim that the Technical Product Owner might be tempted to care first
            about the technology and not about the users needs, a good Technical Product Owner should know when to make what
            trade-off.

            Understanding the technology usually helps understanding the trade-off better. One of the best CTOs I had the pleasure to
            work with did not only have a vast amount of technical knowledge, but was also an amazing salesman with deep
            understanding of the product.

            What does it mean to be <i>too technical</i>? Would you ever say that someone is <i>too business-savvy</i>?
            You can never know too much if you want to stay in the business.
