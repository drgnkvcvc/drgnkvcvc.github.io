            Happy employees code better. Yes, you have read it right. It's the truth and you know it. But getting software engineers
            happy is easier said than done. So how do you build a culture which actually makes people stick around?

            If you have ever been working in any software engineering company you surely must have noticed that people are always unhappy
            about something. Which is perfectly fine, as human are beings who strive to improve and perfect. Even at most
            awesome workplaces I bet you will be able to find at least one person which is unhappy about something, if you
            dare to dig deep enough. But the things people are unhappy about is what differentiates company where the best
            engineers are rushing to get a job and a company which struggles to hire people. </div>

            People would like to come an hour after official work time starts. Somebody is leaving dirty cups in the kitchen. We have
            Xbox instead of PS4. Good, your company is in the right place. Fix those minor things and with time people will
            find some other things to project their unhappiness on. You can fix those as well and people will feel happy
            overall because they are feeling progress.

            But, if your employees are not happy about their projects or about the work process you are in for the trouble. What if I
            do not want to change how my business works, I can just pay them more and they will be happy, right? No, not
            exactly. </div>

            Paying people more to achieve more is not always working. Providing bonuses based on KPIs is approach which is always successful
            only if the workers are performing mechanical labor. For any worker in the knowledge or creativity market bonuses
            often become just a distraction. Plus, unless bonuses are team based, they often happen to have negative impact
            on the team work. I will share my thoughts regarding finances around hiring software engineers in another post,
            in order not to saturate this one.

            What you should do is create an environment which is helping your employees achieve their maximum. Daniel H. Pink provided
            a theory about three main factors which motivate people in his book “Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates
            Us”. Those factors are:
            <br>1. Autonomy
            <br>2. Mastery
            <br>3. Purpose
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-0"></div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12 blog-post-text animated bounceInRight">
            While I agree that these are impacting a big share of what motivates software engineers to perform, there are two other factors
            which I consider crucial. Lets first discuss these three.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row blog-section" id="blog-section">
        <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-0"></div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12 blog-post-text animated bounceInRight">
            <b>Autonomy</b> is vital for software engineers at any level, especially for seasoned coding veterans. Giving
            people the autonomy to decide on how they will deliver can be really empowering. Think about what is really important
            for you and set a clear picture. Define coding standards, expected software performance and timelines, but let
            engineers chose their own OS distribution, IDEs and everything else that can help them deliver value.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row blog-section" id="blog-section">
        <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-0"></div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12 blog-post-text animated bounceInRight">
            <b>Mastery</b> - No matter how some people might seem that they could not care less for their job, anybody in
            the knowledge at creativity market wants to be a master in their trade. Which is more than fairly reasonable,
            and not just because of the job hopping opportunities. You simply do not want to go to work each day thinking
            whether you will be able to perform at a required level. That is why, from time to time, business needs to take
            it slow and give engineers and designers time to learn and grow. Some big companies, like Apple and Google, tend
            to give their employees one day in two weeks or so just for learning and playing. If you are thinking that you
            are not Google and that your business cannot finance time needed to grow your people, you might want to reconsider
            whether you are be the best person to run that business.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row blog-section" id="blog-section">
        <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-0"></div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12 blog-post-text animated bounceInRight">
            <b>Purpose</b> is what drives human being during the whole lifetime, and it is really not surprising that most
            of the people have a need to find a purpose in their work, except for pushing the economy forward. Purpose is
            perhaps the strongest drive amongst these three and can provide a tremendous results. If people feel that they
            are working on something that is awesome they will be motivated to make that thing even better. Even if you are
            producing not-really-interesting-and-fun ERPs you can demonstrate the purpose of it beyond the features. Have
            your engineers spend some time with the people using the software, if you can, and help them understand how they
            will make the life of their users better. After identifying a bug as an issue for a real person, and not just
            some issue in Jira that needs to be resolved, your employees will strive to go above and beyond.

        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12 blog-post-text animated bounceInRight">
            I have mentioned other two factors that can help create an amazing workplace for your engineers. First, the supportive culture.
            Starting day one, coach your employees to support each other any way the can. One might be coding in Java while
            the other codes in PHP, but most of the problems that software development is facing go beyond the technology
            and are solved by the same principles. Also, any money spent on team building is surely money well spent.

    <div class="blog-highlight animated bounceIn">
        Performing better is a never ending quest, as it is making a better workspace for your employees.
    </div>
    <div class="row blog-section" id="blog-section">
        <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-0"></div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12 blog-post-text animated bounceInRight">
            Second, external working conditions. Developer needs a better machine and designer needs a bigger screen? Buy them one. Marketing
            wants ergonomic chairs, while the QA folks wants more testing devices? Invest in those. Somebody is complaining
            about the noise in open space? Build them a cubicle. In the long run, not only that you will make your people
            happy and show that you genuinely care about them, but you will also remove the distractions which could take
            the precious minutes of work each day.

            Performing better is a never ending quest, as it is making a better workspace for your employees. Never stop thriving to
            give the more autonomy, helping them obtain more mastery, finding more purpose in your business and improving
            the supportiveness between the teams. The ball is in your court, help your employees code better.
